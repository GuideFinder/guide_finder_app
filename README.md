## Inner working

In order to get faster and more efficient development, the application was designed to be cross-platform from the beginning. Using the power of [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) and [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) to create simple, beautiful and fast interactions, the users can link more efficiently. 

The app has the two flows which are:

- Traveller flow
- Guide flow

### Traveller flow

This flow explains the steps needed for a traveller to reserve a guide.

`Enter location --> See available guides, --> Guide details --> Reserve --> Sign-in --> Reservation sent --> Enjoy!`

### Guide flow

This flow describes how a guide can register itself to the platform.

`Specify to be a guide --> Take a picture --> Enter your information details --> Wait to help travellers!`
